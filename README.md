# 2P-FENDO_Toolbox
 
## Project:

2P-FENDO-II is a fiber bundle based 2 photon miscroscope for all-optical investigation of neuronal functions in the brain of freely-moving mice.

The provided material, although conceived and applicable under a specific hardware configuration, could be easily adapted onto a regular 2 photon microscope and could provide a good starting point to help user convert a benchtop setup into a functionning all-optical freely-moving setup.
